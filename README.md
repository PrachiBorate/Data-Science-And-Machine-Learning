# Car Price Prediction
This project involves analyzing car data to predict car prices based on features like manufacturer, model, sales, and other specifications. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and predictive modeling using Linear Regression.

##Features
- Data Analysis: Computes statistics (mean, median, mode) and detects outliers.
- Visualization: Scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to explore relationships and trends.
- Machine Learning: Predicts car prices using regression models

## Technologies Used
- Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computing.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression).

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Install Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
